Information technology is the use of computers to create, process, store, retrieve, and exchange all kinds of electronic data and information. IT is typically used within the context of business operations as opposed to personal or entertainment technologies. IT forms part of information and communications technology . Humans have been storing, retrieving, manipulating, and communicating information since the Sumerians in Mesopotamia developed writing in about 3000 BC.

The term is commonly used as a synonym for computers and computer networks, but it also encompasses other information distribution technologies such as television and telephones. Several products or services within an economy are associated with information technology, including computer hardware, software, electronics, semiconductors, internet, telecom equipment, and e-commerce. Information technology is also a branch of computer science, which can be defined as the overall study of procedure, structure, and the processing of various types of data. As this field continues to evolve across the world, the overall priority and importance has also grown, which is where we begin to see the introduction of computer science-related courses in K-12 education.

However, concerns have been raised about this fact that most schools are lacking advanced-placement courses in this field.

History of Computer Technology

The Zuse Z3 is the first programmable computer.

Search System

A software and hardware complex with a web interface that provides the ability to search for information on the Internet. A search engine usually means a site that hosts the interface of the system. Most search engines look for information on World Wide Web sites, but there are also systems that can look for files on FTP servers, items in online stores, and information on Usenet newsgroups.

Commercial and Employment Perspective

It is also worth noting that from a business perspective, Information Technology departments are a “cost center” the majority of the time. " Modern businesses rely heavily on technology for their day-to-day operations, so the expenses delegated to cover technology that facilitates business in a more efficient manner are usually seen as “just the cost of doing business." IT departments are allocated funds by senior leadership and must attempt to achieve the desired deliverables while staying within that budget. Companies have also sought to integrate IT with business outcomes and decision-making through a BizOps or business operations department. In a business context, the Information Technology Association of America has defined information technology as "the study, design, development, application, implementation, support, or management of computer-based information systems".

The responsibilities of those working in the field include network administration, software development and installation, and the planning and management of an organization's technology life cycle, by which hardware and software are maintained, upgraded, and replaced.

The Need for Computer Security

When talking about computer security, most of us think about computers being hacked or taken over by cybercriminals. However, computer security doesn't only deal with protecting the internal components of a computer, but also protecting them from natural disasters like tornadoes, floods, fires, etc. Computer security basically is short for "protecting the computer from harm," meaning from natural disasters, cyber criminals, or pretty much anything that can hurt the computer internally or externally. Cybersecurity is a big topic under the computer security category as this basically deals with protecting technology from unwanted cyber criminals or trolls. With computer security, there comes a need for professionals, or people who have educational experience in the different fields of this profession to help protect networks, databases, and computer systems from internal and external threats that could potentially cause harm.

These contain everything from the general topic of computer science, computer engineering, software engineering, information systems, and computer systems.

Software is a set of computer programs and associated documentation and data. This is in contrast to hardware, from which the system is built and which actually performs the work. Machine language consists of groups of binary values signifying processor instructions that change the state of the computer from its preceding state. High-level languages are translated into machine language using a compiler or an interpreter or a combination of the two.

Software may also be written in a low-level assembly language, which has a strong correspondence to the computer's machine language instructions and is translated into machine language using an assembler.

Main article: History of software

Because of the proofs and the algorithm, she is considered the first computer programmer. The first theory about software, prior to the creation of computers as we know them today, was proposed by Alan Turing in his 1935 essay, On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem . In 2000, Fred Shapiro, a librarian at the Yale Law School, published a letter revealing that John Wilder Tukey's 1958 paper «The Teaching of Concrete Mathematics» contained the earliest known usage of the term «software» found in a search of JSTOR's electronic archives, predating the OED's citation by two years.

Purpose, or domain of use

Application software uses the computer system to perform special functions beyond the basic operation of the computer itself. System software manages hardware behaviour, as to provide basic functionalities that are required by users, or for other software to run properly, if at all. Operating systems are essential collections of software that manage resources and provide common services for other software that runs «on top» of them. In practice, an operating system comes bundled with additional software so that a user can potentially do some work with a computer that only has one operating system.

Device drivers operate or control a particular type of device that is attached to a computer. Malware is closely associated with computer-related crimes, though some malicious programs may have been designed as practical jokes.

Nature or domain of execution

Desktop applications such as web browsers and Microsoft Office and LibreOffice and WordPerfect, as well as smartphone and tablet applications . JavaScript scripts are pieces of software traditionally embedded in web pages that are run directly inside the web browser when a web page is loaded without the need for a web browser plugin.



Embedded software resides as firmware within embedded systems, devices dedicated to a single use or a few uses such as cars and televisions . In the embedded system context there is sometimes no clear distinction between the system software and the application software. However, some embedded systems run embedded operating systems, and these systems do retain the distinction between system software and application software . Microcode is a special, relatively obscure type of embedded software which tells the processor itself how to execute machine code, so it is actually a lower level than machine code.

It is typically proprietary to the processor manufacturer, and any necessary correctional microcode software updates are supplied by them to users .

Main article: Programming tool

IDEs may do this by either invoking the relevant individual tools or by re-implementing their functionality in a new way. Many programming language implementations provide the option of using both individual tools or an IDE.

On a PC one will usually have the ability to change the platform software. Application software is often purchased separately from computer hardware. Sometimes applications are bundled with the computer, but that does not change the fact that they run as independent applications. Applications are usually independent programs from the operating system, though they are often tailored for specific platforms.

Most users think of compilers, databases, and other «system software» as applications. User software includes spreadsheet templates and word processor templates. Even email filters are a kind of user software. Users create this software themselves and often overlook how important it is.

Depending on how competently the user-written software has been integrated into default application packages, many users may not be aware of the distinction between the original packages, and what has been added by co-workers.

Main article: Execution

Computer software has to be «loaded» into the computer's storage . Once the software has loaded, the computer is able to execute the software. This involves passing instructions from the application software, through the system software, to the hardware which ultimately receives the instruction as machine code.

Main articles: Software patent and Software patent debate

Software patents, like other types of patents, are theoretically supposed to give an inventor an exclusive, time-limited license for a detailed idea on how to implement a piece of software, or a component of a piece of software. So software patents are supposed to cover the middle area, between requirements and concrete implementation. Software patents are controversial in the software industry with many people holding different views about them.


Computer Science

Computer science is the study of the theory, experimentation, and engineering that form the basis for the design and use of computers. It is the scientific and practical approach to computation and its applications and the systematic study of the feasibility, structure, expression, and mechanization of the methodical procedures that underlie the acquisition, representation, processing, storage, communication of, and access to information.

Informatics

Informatics is a branch of information engineering. It involves the practice of information processing and the engineering of information systems, and as an academic field it is an applied form of information science. The field considers the interaction between humans and information alongside the construction of interfaces, organisations, technologies and systems.

Methodologies

One system development methodology is not necessarily suitable for use by all projects.

Identification of need

The sources of ideas for software products are plentiful. These ideas can come from market research including the demographics of potential new customers, existing customers, sales prospects who rejected the product, other internal software development staff, or a creative third party. Ideas for software products are usually first evaluated by marketing personnel for economic feasibility, for fit with existing channels distribution, for possible effects on existing product lines, required features, and for fit with the company's marketing objectives. Yet, software product planning is critical to the development success and absolutely requires knowledge of multiple disciplines.

Planning process

An important task in creating a software program is extracting the requirements or requirements analysis. Customers typically have an abstract idea of what they want as an end result but do not know what software should do. Skilled and experienced software engineers recognize incomplete, ambiguous, or even contradictory requirements at this point. Frequently demonstrating live code may help reduce the risk that the requirements are incorrect.

In computer programming both software development and web development refers to the same engineer or programmer and the process of coding. Software development is focused on the programs used in computer systems. Software developers are responsible for the concept, creation, programming, some documenting, testing, improving and maintaining the software and its software components. Software developers create programs and mobile applications for stand-alone desktop computers and mobile devices and their platforms.

Software developers need to have understanding of not only development best practices, but also the theory behind the programming.

View model

A view model is a framework that provides the viewpoints on the system and its environment, to be used in the software development process.

Business process and data modelling

Graphical representation of the current state of information provides a very effective means for presenting information to both users and system developers. The interview consists of a facilitator asking a series of questions designed to extract required information that describes a process. The interviewer is called a facilitator to emphasize that it is the participants who provide the information. The methodology is important because usually a team of facilitators is collecting information across the facility and the results of the information from all the interviewers must fit together once completed.

Generation of process and data models can be used to determine if the existing processes and information systems are sound and only need minor modifications or enhancements, or if re-engineering is required as a corrective action. The creation of business models is more than a way to view or automate your information process.

Modeling language

A modeling language is any artificial language that can be used to express information or knowledge or systems in a structure that is defined by a consistent set of rules.

Programming paradigm

A programming paradigm is a fundamental style of computer programming, which is not generally dictated by the project management methodology . Paradigms differ in the concepts and abstractions used to represent the elements of a program and the steps that comprise a computation .


Overview

Pair programming, an agile development technique used by XP. Most agile development methods break product development work into small increments that minimize the amount of up-front planning and design. Through incremental development, products have room to «fail often and early» throughout each iterative phase instead of drastically on a final release date. Working software is the primary measure of progress.

A key advantage of agile approaches is speed to market and risk mitigation.

Efficient and face-to-face communication

The 6th principle of the agile manifesto for software development states «The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation». No matter which development method is followed, every team should include a customer representative . This representative is agreed by stakeholders to act on their behalf and makes a personal commitment to being available for developers to answer questions throughout the iteration. At the end of each iteration, the project stakeholders together with the customer representative review progress and re-evaluate priorities with a view to optimizing the return on investment and ensuring alignment with customer needs and company goals.

In agile software development, an information radiator is a physical display, board with sticky notes or similar, located prominently near the development team, where passers-by can see it. It presents an up-to-date summary of the product development status. A build light indicator may also be used to inform a team about the current status of their product development.

Philosophy

Compared to traditional software engineering, agile software development mainly targets complex systems and product development with dynamic, non-deterministic and non-linear characteristics. Agile practitioners will seek to reduce the leap-of-faith that is needed before any evidence of value can be obtained. These basic arguments and previous industry experiences, learned from years of successes and failures, have helped shape agile development's favor of adaptive, iterative and evolutionary development. Development methods exist on a continuum from adaptive to predictive.

Agile software development methods lie on the adaptive side of this continuum. One key of adaptive development methods is a rolling wave approach to schedule planning, which identifies milestones but leaves flexibility in the path to reach them, and also allows for the milestones themselves to change. In the extremes, a predictive team can report exactly what features and tasks are planned for the entire length of the development process. Agile vs.

One of the differences between agile software development methods and waterfall is the approach to quality and testing. In agile software development, however, testing is completed in the same iteration as programming. After the users know the real value of the updated piece of software, they can make better decisions about the software's future. This iterative approach supports a product rather than a project mindset.

Within project management, scrum, sometimes written Scrum or SCRUM, is a framework for developing, delivering, and sustaining products in a complex environment, with an initial emphasis on software development, although it has been used in other fields including research, sales, marketing and advanced technologies. The scrum team assess progress in time-boxed daily meetings of 15 minutes or less, called daily scrums .

Key ideas

Scrum is a lightweight, iterative and incremental framework for developing, delivering, and sustaining complex products. These changes come from a variety of sources, but according to scrum, understanding why is irrelevant, and change should simply be accepted, embraced and analyzed for benefits. As such, scrum adopts an evidence-based empirical approach – accepting that the problem cannot be fully understood or defined up front, and instead focusing on how to maximize the team's ability to deliver quickly, to respond to emerging requirements, and to adapt to evolving technologies and changes in market conditions.

Scrum team

The fundamental unit of scrum is a small team of people, consisting of a product owner, a scrum master, and developers.

Developers

While no work should come to the team except through the product owner, and the scrum master is expected to protect the team from distractions, the team are encouraged to interact directly with customers and/or stakeholders to gain maximum understanding and immediacy of feedback.

Scrum emphasizes valuable, actionable output at the end of the sprint that just was completed.

Daily scrum

A daily scrum in the computing room. All developers come prepared. No detailed discussions should happen during the daily scrum. Once over, individual members can discuss issues in detail, often known as a 'breakout session' or an 'after party'.

Blockers identified should be collectively discussed outside of the daily scrum with a view to working toward a resolution.

Backlog refinement

Although not originally a core scrum practice, backlog refinement was added to the Scrum Guide and adopted as a way of managing the quality of product backlog items entering a sprint.

Reasons for modifying the backlog and items within may include

The backlog can also include technical debt . This is a concept in software development that reflects the implied cost of additional rework caused by choosing an easy solution now instead of using a better approach that would take longer. It is recommended to invest of up to 10 percent of a team's sprint capacity upon backlog refinement.

Canceling a sprint

The product owner can cancel a sprint if necessary, and may do so with input from others .

Management

Having well-established rules about how work is added, removed and ordered helps the whole team make better decisions about how to change the product. The product owner prioritizes product backlog items based on which are needed soonest. Developers, influenced by the sprint goal, choose items for coming sprint, moving those items from the product backlog to the sprint backlog, which is the list of items they will build. The further down the backlog, the less detailed items will be.

All of these new ideas tend to trigger the team to adapt the backlog to incorporate new knowledge. The world changes, the backlog is never finished.

Sprint backlog

The sprint backlog is the subset of items from the product backlog intended for developers to address in the upcoming sprint. This promotes self-organization of the developers. The sprint backlog is the property of the developers, and all included estimates are provided by the developers.

Increment

The increment must be complete, according to the scrum team's definition of done , fully functioning, and in a usable condition regardless of whether the product owner decides to actually deploy and use it.

Adaptations

Scrum is used in a variety of contexts to achieve many different aims. To accomplish those varying ends, Scrum is frequently tailored or adapted. For example, at the start of product development, organizations commonly add process guidance on the business case, requirements gathering and prioritization, initial high-level design, and budget and schedule forecasting. Various authors and communities of people who use scrum have also suggested more detailed techniques for how to apply or adapt scrum to particular problems or organizations.

Large-scale scrum

Large-scale scrum is a product development framework that extends scrum with scaling rules and guidelines without losing the original purposes of scrum. «Scaling Scrum starts with understanding and being able to adopt standard real one-team Scrum. «Bas Vodde and Craig Larman evolved the LeSS framework from their experiences working with large-scale product development, especially in the telecoms and finance industries. « It evolved by taking Scrum and trying many different experiments to discover what works.

Extreme programming is a software development methodology intended to improve software quality and responsiveness to changing customer requirements. As a type of agile software development, it advocates frequent releases in short development cycles, intended to improve productivity and introduce checkpoints at which new customer requirements can be adopted. The methodology takes its name from the idea that the beneficial elements of traditional software engineering practices are taken to «extreme» levels.

History

Kent Beck developed extreme programming during his work on the Chrysler Comprehensive Compensation System payroll project. He began to refine the development methodology used in the project and wrote a book on the methodology . For example, the «practice of test-first development, planning and writing tests before each micro-increment» was used as early as NASA's Project Mercury, in the early 1960s. To shorten the total development time, some formal test documents have been developed in parallel with the software being ready for testing.

Two major influences shaped software development in the 1990s

Rapidly changing requirements demanded shorter product life-cycles, and often clashed with traditional methods of software development. The Chrysler Comprehensive Compensation System started in order to determine the best way to use object technologies, using the payroll systems at Chrysler as the object of research, with Smalltalk as the language and GemStone as the data access layer. Chrysler brought in Kent Beck, a prominent Smalltalk practitioner, to do performance tuning on the system, but his role expanded as he noted several problems with the development process. He took this opportunity to propose and implement some changes in development practices - based on his work with his frequent collaborator, Ward Cunningham.

Beck invited Ron Jeffries to the project to help develop and refine these methods. Also, XP concepts have been explained , for several years, using a hypertext system map on the XP website at http://www.extremeprogramming.org circa 1999. Beck edited a series of books on XP, beginning with his own Extreme Programming Explained , spreading his ideas to a much larger audience.

Current state

XP generated significant interest among software communities in the late 1990s and early 2000s, seeing adoption in a number of environments radically different from its origins. A less-rigid schedule allows, instead, the development of complex features over a period of several days. Meanwhile, other agile-development practices have not stood still, and as of 2019 XP continues to evolve, assimilating more lessons from experiences in the field, to use other practices. In the second edition of Extreme Programming Explained , five years after the first edition, Beck added more values and practices and differentiated between primary and corollary practices.

Activities

The advocates of XP argue that the only truly important product of the system development process is code – software instructions that a computer can interpret. Coding can also help to communicate thoughts about programming problems. A programmer dealing with a complex programming problem, or finding it hard to explain the solution to fellow programmers, might code it in a simplified manner and use the code to demonstrate what they mean. Other programmers can give feedback on this code by also coding their thoughts.

Listening

Programmers must listen to what the customers need the system to do, what «business logic» is needed.

Values

A new value, respect, was added in the second edition of Extreme Programming Explained.

Communication

Building software systems requires communicating system requirements to the developers of the system. The goal is to give all developers a shared view of the system which matches the view held by the users of the system.

Simplicity

Extreme programming encourages starting with the simplest solution. The difference between this approach and more conventional system development methods is the focus on designing and coding for the needs of today instead of those of tomorrow, next week, or next month. Feedback is closely related to communication and simplicity. Flaws in the system are easily communicated by writing a unit test that proves a certain piece of code will break.

The direct feedback from the system tells programmers to recode this part. A customer is able to test the system periodically according to the functional requirements, known as user stories. To quote Kent Beck, «Optimism is an occupational hazard of programming. Feedback is the treatment.».

Courage

Several practices embody courage. Courage enables developers to feel comfortable with refactoring their code when necessary. This means reviewing the existing system and modifying it so that future changes can be implemented more easily.

Respect

Programmers should never commit changes that break compilation, that make existing unit-tests fail, or that otherwise delay the work of their peers. Members respect their own work by always striving for high quality and seeking for the best design for the solution at hand through refactoring.

Rules

29 rules are given in the categories of planning, managing, designing, coding, and testing. Planning, managing and designing are called out explicitly to counter claims that XP doesn't support those activities. Another version of XP rules was proposed by Ken Auer in XP/Agile Universe 2003.

Principles

The principles that form the basis of XP are based on the values just described and are intended to foster decisions in a system development project. Extreme programming sees feedback as most useful if it is done frequently and promptly. Unlike traditional system development methods, contact with the customer occurs in more frequent iterations. The customer has clear insight into the system that is being developed, and can give feedback and steer the development as needed.

When writing code, running the unit test provides direct feedback as to how the system reacts to the changes made.
